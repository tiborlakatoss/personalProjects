//A website requires the users to input username and password to register. 
//		Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
//Following are the criteria for checking the password:
//1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
//2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
//1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
//3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
//4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
//5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
//
//Extra:
//Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria.
//		Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
//Example
//If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
//ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
//Then, the output of the program should be:
//ABd1234@1
