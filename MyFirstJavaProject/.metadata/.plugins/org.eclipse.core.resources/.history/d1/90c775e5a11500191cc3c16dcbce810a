//		The user enters a price and then the amount of money given. 
//		The program will figure out the change and the number of bills and coins to return. 
//			Return the change in as few bills/coins as possible.
//		Note: Consider the bills/coins of Romaina (500,200,100,50,10,5,1 bills and 50,10,5,1 coins)
//		Example Input:
//		Price: 14.33
//		Money amount: 100
//		Output :
//		Total Change: 85.67 Lei 
//		1 x 50 Lei
//		3 x 10 Lei
//		1 x 5 Lei
//		1 x 50 Bani
//		1 x 10 Bani
//		1 x 5 Bani
//		2 x 1 Bani
//		Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. 
//	The transaction log format is shown as following:
//		D 200
//		W 100
//		¡
//		D means deposit while W means withdrawal. 'i' meaning balance information
//		Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
//		D 300
//		D 300
//		W 200
//		D 100
//		¡
//		Then, the output should be:
//		500
//		Extra 1: validate account always has enough money. don't allow operations of W if not enough money
//		Extra 2: add L operation, loan, can withdraw even if it's < 0 to a limit of 10000
