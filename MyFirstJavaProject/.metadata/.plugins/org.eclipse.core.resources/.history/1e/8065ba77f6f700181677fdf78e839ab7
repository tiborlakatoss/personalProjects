//		Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty. The first level of difficulty would 
//		be a number between 1 and 10. The second difficulty
////		set would be between 1 and 100. The third difficulty set would be between 1 and 1000. Prompt for the 
//		difficulty level, and then start the game.The computer picks a random number in that range and prompts the player to guess that number.
//		Each time the player guesses, the compute should give the player a hint as to whether the number is too high or too low. 
//		The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the player guesses the correct number, 
//		the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if the player would like to play again.
////
////		Let's play Guess the Number.
//		Pick a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 1
//		I have my number.
//		What's your guess?
//		1
//		Too low. Guess again:F
//		5
//		Too high. Guess again:
//		2
//		You got it in 3 guesses!
//		Play again? n
//		Goodbye!
